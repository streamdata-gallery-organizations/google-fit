  title: Google Fit API Create Data Source
  description: Creates a new data source that is unique across all data sources belonging
    to this user. The data stream ID field can be omitted and will be generated by
    the server with the correct format. The data stream ID is an ordered combination
    of some fields from the data source. In addition to the data source fields reflected
    into the data source ID, the developer project number that is authenticated when
    creating the data source is included. This developer project number is obfuscated
    when read by any other developer reading public data types.
